### Simple jwt and access control

jwt can check for the secret to give authorization

eg: secret: 'adminsecret'

route can check for secret: 'adminsecret'


Note for me: 
If I want to create different user roles in the app, wouldn't be better to have different login points for this kind of access?

Short thought ...
